    // Présentation
    'presentation.text' => 'Passionate about web and mobile development, I started my journey as a self-taught developer on OpenClassrooms, before collaborating with a senior developer on my first front-end freelance projects. After two years of learning alongside my professional activity, I validated a Bac+2 in web and mobile web development at Online FormaPro (December 2023), then completed an enriching internship at Hubwiser. I then joined Sportyneo as a full stack developer in work-study, where I was able to deepen my technical skills, collaborate on various projects and develop a global vision of digital project management. In July 2025, I obtained a Bachelor 3 Digital Project Manager, with a specialization in design, application development and cybersecurity. Today, I put my skills at the service of innovative projects, as a full stack developer or digital project manager, ready to take on new challenges and support companies and entrepreneurs in their digital transformation.',

    'projects.hemadex.title' => 'Hemadex',
    'projects.hemadex.description' => 'VOD platform dedicated to European historical martial arts (HEMA). The site offers tutorial videos, competitions, and free or paid content. I developed the entire backend with Symfony and API Platform, set up video storage on AWS S3, and integrated Stripe for payment management. The frontend is developed in React.js. The site also allows users to discover fencing masters and historical techniques.',

    'projects.flavourfusion.title' => 'FlavourFusion',
    'projects.flavourfusion.description' => 'I completed an exciting solo project using Vue.js 3 and the Cocktail DB API. The main objective was to design a cocktail site, offering users the ability to search for cocktails by name, category and ingredients. I was able to successfully meet this challenge in just one week, well before the two-week deadline. The integration of the Cocktail DB API was an essential aspect of the project. This allowed me to retrieve detailed data on cocktails, including their names, categories and ingredients. I used the API\'s query features to allow users to specifically search for cocktails that match their preferences. Overall, this project allowed me to improve my web development skills, particularly with Vue.js 3. I gained valuable experience in manipulating data from a third-party API and creating an interactive user interface.',

    'projects.homeaway.title' => 'HomeAway',
    'projects.homeaway.description' => 'I participated in an exciting team project with 3 people, where I was responsible for the front-end. The project consisted of creating a vacation rental booking site using Altorouter, PHP, JS and Twig. This project was my first object-oriented development (OOP) experience, which added an interesting dimension to my learning. This project allowed me to discover the benefits of OOP in terms of maintainability, reusability and code flexibility. I gained valuable experience in applying OOP principles in a real project, which strengthened my web development skills and broadened my software design perspectives. To start, I used Leaflet to create an interactive map allowing users to visualize the locations of available accommodations. I added markers on the map and pop-ups displaying key information about each accommodation. This allowed users to navigate easily and find accommodations that interested them. Next, I set up a horizontal scroll to display the different images of each accommodation. When an image was selected, I made sure it was centered on the screen, thus offering a pleasant and intuitive visual experience for users. I was also responsible for setting up a calendar, allowing users to select their stay dates. This required data manipulation and appropriate validation to ensure reservations were made correctly. As a team member, I also contributed to the back-end. I used the Google API to retrieve geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when a new accommodation was registered. I also worked on setting up search filters to help users find accommodations that met their specific criteria. Additionally, I set up a 404 error page to handle errors and provide a consistent user experience. This project allowed me to strengthen my web development skills, particularly with Altorouter, PHP, JS and Twig. I was able to explore new features and technologies, while working closely with my team.',

    'projects.kitsutheque.title' => 'Kitsuthèque',
    'projects.kitsutheque.description' => 'I had the opportunity to lead a group project in my training, which was an enriching experience. Our goal was to create a site for a library, but we decided to focus specifically on creating a manga library. Unfortunately, we were only two members instead of three to complete this project in a 4-week timeframe. The site was developed using HTML, SCSS, JS, PHP and MySQL. As development leader, I assumed responsibilities on both the front-end and back-end. I entirely designed the site design, ensuring I created a user-friendly and attractive interface for users. On the front-end side, I developed all the features intended for users, as well as part of the admin side. I coded elements such as the search bar, which allowed users to search for specific mangas. I also set up a catalog filtering system using fetch, which allowed users to sort mangas by category, genre, etc. Additionally, I integrated a slider and swipe functionality to facilitate user navigation on the site. Regarding the back-end, I developed features intended for users, such as search and filter management. I ensured that search results were returned quickly and efficiently. I also worked on part of the admin side, allowing the management of mangas, users and associated data. Despite the challenge of being only two members to complete this project in the allotted time, we managed to create a functional and attractive manga library. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in coordinating a development team, as well as in designing and implementing features on both the front-end and back-end.',

In just one week, I managed to materialize this vision and bring to life a functional and aesthetic site. Adding JavaScript made the site interactive and dynamic. I implemented features such as animations, hover effects and interactive forms to improve the user experience. This solo project was an opportunity to put into practice my time management and organization skills. I worked with discipline to meet deadlines and give my best to complete this project.',

    'projects.caeli.title' => 'Caeli',
    'projects.caeli.description' => 'My first project completed for a client outside of school. I had the opportunity to work on an example site, based on specifications provided by the client. The goal of this site is to serve as a demonstration for a company considering moving to the next step. For this project, I used HTML, SCSS and JS languages. The site was developed following the client\'s specifications, focusing on creating a convincing and functional interface. Currently, the site is coded statically, with basic features. If the project is validated, I will have the opportunity to continue development by creating a database and implementing the PHP part. This will make the site interactive and dynamic, offering advanced features. During the completion of this project, I worked closely with the client to understand their needs and expectations. I translated these requirements into code, using HTML to structure the site optimally. With SCSS, I was able to style elements attractively and in line with the client\'s vision. Using JavaScript allowed me to add interactive features to the site, thus improving the user experience. I ensured that interactions were smooth and intuitive, offering pleasant navigation for visitors. This project represents an exciting challenge and an opportunity for me to put into practice my web development skills.',

This project was completed solo and was completed in just 4 days, from the start of the mockup to the finalization of the code. It\'s a "onepage" project developed using HTML, CSS and JS languages. The goal was to create a single page that groups all essential information. While working on this project, I was able to put into practice my web development knowledge that I acquired before the HTML, CSS, JS training. This project was an opportunity for me to take on a challenge by working autonomously and respecting tight deadlines. I was able to put into practice my technical skills and develop my ability to manage a project from A to Z.',
